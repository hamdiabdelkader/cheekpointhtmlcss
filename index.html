      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p id="bi">
        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American
        entrepreneur, industrial designer, business magnate, media proprietor,
        and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the
        chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney
        Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the
        founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer
        of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with
        his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        Main article: Apple II series The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer,
        one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer
        products,[78] designed primarily by Wozniak while Jobs oversaw the
        development of the Apple II's unusual case[241] and Rod Holt developed
        the unique power supply.[76] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast
        Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by
        Apple.

        Main article: Apple Lisa The Lisa is a personal computer developed by
        Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s. It is the first personal
        computer with a graphical user interface for business users.[242] The
        Lisa sold poorly, at 100,000 units.[243] In 1982, after Jobs was forced
        out of the Lisa project,[244] he took over the Macintosh project, adding
        inspiration from Lisa. The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the
        Macintosh XL.[245]

        Main article: iMac Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its
        innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple.
        Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of
        anyone else's".[256] Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in
        Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before.
        In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has
        varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the
        all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection
        with the user such as the handle and a "breathing" light effect when the
        computer went to sleep.[257] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that
        time. The iMac also featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing
        the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting
        peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in
        the interface being popularized among third-party peripheral makers—as
        evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of
        translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).[258]
